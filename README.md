</div>

## Overview
YT Summarizer for KoboldAI is a simple command-line program that uses KoboldAI's Alpaca-13b model to generate summaries of YouTube video transcripts. The program is a quick proof of concept and is limited by the context of AI models, which is currently limited to 2048 tokens, so it may not work well with long videos.

## Instructions

To use this program, please follow the instructions below:

1. Load up KoboldAI with the `--api` argument to start the API.
2. Select your model, such as Llama, OPT, Alpaca, Seq2Seq, etc.
3. Run the `.sh` or `.bat` file.

## Disclaimer

Please note that this is a proof of concept and may not work perfectly. The quality of the summaries generated by the program depends on the quality of the AI models used. This program is for experimental purposes only and should not be used in any production environment.
